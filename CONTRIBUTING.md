## Reporting issues ##
We use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/uxFeranmi/neuronic/issues)
to track bugs, feature requests and questions.

Before filing a new issue, please search the tracker to check if it's already
covered by an existing report. Avoiding duplicates helps us maximize the time we
can spend fixing bugs and adding new features.

When filing an issue, be sure to provide enough information for us to
efficiently diagnose and reproduce the problem. In particular, please include
all of the information requested in the issue template.

## Pull requests ##
We accept contributions with the [fork and pull model](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-collaborative-development-models). You're welcome to fork the repo and make changes. Pull requests should generally merge into the `devel` branch.
